## Description
For this project, I have designed a clock and a name block using different kinds of segments. 
- Clock
The clock uses six seven-segment displays to show the hour, minute and second. I can set the time using binary inputs for each part of the clock. For example, if I input 10010 for the hour, the clock will start at 18 and then count up.
- Name block
The name block uses various segments to spell out my name(Milad). At first, all the segments are off and after five seconds, the first letter of my name appears. Then, the next letter appears after another five seconds, and so on until my whole name is shown. After that, my name will blink until the end of the day.

## Installation

All you need is to install Proteus Design Suite 7.0 to see the result.
